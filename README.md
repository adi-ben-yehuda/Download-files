# Download files from the server through the browser

## Introduction
In this project, the client sends through the browser using the TCP protocol, to the server the name of the file from which he wishes to download (that is, for the server to send back to him). The server sends the correct file to the client and the file data is displayed in the browser.

## General Information
This project implements a TCP server that functions as follows: The client sends to the server the name of a file he wishes to download from (that is, for the server to send back to him).
The files are located in a folder named files which is in the same folder where the server is located. The file name can also include a path. That is, if the client sent only the name of the file, then the file should be inside the files folder at the top level. If the file name also contains a folder path, the server searches for the file according to the path inside the files folder.
The format in which the client sends to the server is the following format: in the first line it says: GET [file] HTTP/1.1
When instead of [file] the name of the file will be written.
We will specify that if the name of the file is a single character / (slash), then it means the file named: index.html

The client has finished sending the message when it sends a new line twice, i.e. \r\n\r\n
If the file exists, the server will return:

~~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: [conn]
Content-Length: [length]
~~~~

Then a blank line, then the contents of the file.
When, instead of [conn] the value of the connection field that appeared in the client's request will be listed, and instead of [length] the size of the sent file will appear. Note, length is the number of bytes that are actually sent.
For example, the client sent:

~~~~
GET / HTTP/1.1
…
Connection: close
…
~~~~

The client sent additional information - marked by three dots, but it is not relevant because our server ignores it.
And the server sent back the following response along with the content of the index.html file:

~~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Length: 11

hello world
~~~~~

If the value of the connection field is close (as in the example above), close the connection after sending the file and handle the next connection. On the other hand, if the value is keep-alive, the connection must be left open - and the client's next file request must be read as part of that connection.

We will set the socket to a maximum period of time in which it is stuck on recv.
The current connection on the server must be closed if the recv does not receive a response after 1 second, and handle the next client (new connection). Alternatively, if the server receives empty requests from the client, also in this case the current connection on the server must be closed and handle the next client (new connection).

This is the behavior for all types of files, except for files with the extension jpg or ico. In such a case, the content of the file must be read on the server in binary form and then sent. For example:

~~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: [length]

[binary image data]
~~~~~

If the file does not exist, the server returns:

~~~~~
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Connection: close

~~~~~

If the client requested a file named: 

~~~~
GET /redirect HTTP/1.1
~~~~

The server returns:

~~~~
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Connection: close
Location: /result.html

~~~~

Please note, in the case of 404 and 301 you must always return: Connection: close
It doesn't matter what appeared in the connection field that came from the client, close the connection and continue to the next connection.

In addition, the server must print to the screen the requests it received from the client. The entire request - but without any addition.

An example of browsing /redirect. The browser changed the address according to the logic defined above.

## Installation
Before installing this project, you need to install on your computer:
* Git

After it, run the following commands in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/adi-ben-yehuda/Download-files.git
```
You must type the following in the address bar of the browser (chrome):
```
http://[Server IP]:[Server port][Path]
```
That is, the IP address of the server, colons, then the port your server is listening to, then the path of the file. For example: 
```
http://1.2.3.4:80/
```
This line addresses the server located at address 1.2.3.4 and listens to port 80 and requests the path /
If you run the server on your computer, you can write localhost instead of the local IP address 127.0.0.1

Open new terminals for the server and run the following command:

```
python server.py port
```
For example: 
```
python server.py 12345
```
